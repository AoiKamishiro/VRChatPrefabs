# Shader for Unity AKSlideShow (formerly Multi Texture Poster Shader)

version 3.0.0  
[Japanese Readme][00].  

Created by Aoi Kamishiro ([@aoi3192][01])  

## Overview
This is a shader that can switch between up to 32 textures without any prior processing, such as atlasing. The switching is done automatically, so there is no need to create dedicated animations.  
Also, since it supports GPU instances, it can reduce the load even when a large number of instances are installed.  

## Features
Switch between Unlit and Standard Shading.  
Manual mode allows you to manually specify the image to be displayed.  
Selection of four automatic switching modes: Simple/Slide/Texture/XFade.  
Slide mode allows the user to specify the direction of slide (up, down, left, right).  
Use GPU instances to reduce load.
